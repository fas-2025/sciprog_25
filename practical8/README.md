# Practical 8
This folder contains the code for practical 8.
It looks at recursive functions in C.
In particular, this program calculates the greatest common divisor of a pair of integers
provided by the user. It does so by using Euclid's algorithim in a iterative and recursive
fashion.

## Compile:

* gcc -o gcd gcd.c

## Execute:

* ./gcd

## Output:

* gcd
Please input two positive integers:
10 2
Iterative GCD(10, 2) = 2
Recursive GCD(10, 2) = 2

Please input two positive integers:
10 2
Iterative GCD(10, 2) = 2
Recursive GCD(10, 2) = 2
