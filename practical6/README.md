# Practical 6
This folder contains the code for practical 6.
It looks at perfomring matrix multiplication (C = A*B) at first and then
following from Step6, it uses functions and makefiles for compilation. 

You will find that steps 1 through to 5 are in this current directory and step 6/7 are within the Step6 folder.
The Step6 procedures have their own makefile inside that directory.

## Compile:

* gcc matmult.c matmultc

## Execute:

* ./matmultc

## Output:

* matmultc
This is matrix A

  0  1  2
  1  2  3
  2  3  4
  3  4  5
  4  5  6

 This is matrix B

  0 -1 -2 -3
  1  0 -1 -2
  2  1  0 -1

 This is matrix C

  5  2 -1 -4
  8  2 -4-10
 11  2 -7-16
